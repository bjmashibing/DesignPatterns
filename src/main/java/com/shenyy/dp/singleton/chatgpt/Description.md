##Singleton

Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern in software development that restricts a class to have only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This ensures that the class only has one instance across the entire application, making it easy to manage and maintain the state of the object.

In this example, the Singleton class has a private constructor to prevent external classes from creating multiple instances of the class. The getInstance method is used to access the singleton instance and creates the instance if it doesn't exist. The method is also synchronized to ensure that it is thread-safe.
